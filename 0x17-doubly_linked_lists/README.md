# Doubly Linked Lists

## Synopsis
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the C programming language: manipulating doubly linked lists by printing/inserting/deleting nodes,
> freeing nodes, and using the node data (e.g. to get a total sum)

### Description of what each file shows:
* lists.h .................. header file with structure defined and function prototypes
* Files that start with:
1. prints all the elements
2. returns the number of elements in linked list
3. adds a new node at the beginning
4. adds a new node at the end
5. frees linked list
6. returns the nth node
7. returns the sum of all the data in list
8. inserts a new node at a given position
9. deletes the node at index

## Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
